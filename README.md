# IoT Smart-Robotic-Car 2019

# Proposal
Robotics has been in the major leagues in Technology and has continued growing further on since then, from Smart Robotic Dogs to Self-Driving Smart Cars and A.I. Technology. It has always been one of my major interests and topics to talk about. In my younger years as an infant, I’ve always loved playing around with Remote Controlled Cars and as I grew older it has only furnished good memories when reflecting back. At the age 17 when I still had my RC Car, I dared to open it up out of curiosity to have a peak at the inner workings of the system. I couldn’t have been more fascinated by the mechanics even when I had little knowledge of technology back then, but still, I had the tendency of breaking things and putting it back together. Fast forward to now, I’ve learned so much about the innovation of Technology and how it has had a major impact in our daily lives. The innovation of Autonomous Technology such as Autonomous Drones and Smart-Cars etc. have had a substantial growth over the past few years. Elon Musk’s Tesla Brand which consists of a range of Smart autonomous vehicle Models, from the Tesla Roadster, Model X to the Model Y and the recent debut of the Semi Tesla Truck. The Model 3 of the Tesla Brand also won the ‘Top Safety Award’ from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which is major news, considering that it is always been improved by updates. Vehicle Brands such as Mercedes, Audi, Toyota, Nissan and many others are also pursuing Vehicular Autonomy with their prototypes which is slowly shaping the future of Technology seen in video games into real life.
The Project that I'm going to propose is a Robotic Car controlled by a Smartphone via an IR Remote or the app.
